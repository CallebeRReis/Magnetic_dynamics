# Magnetic Dynamics

## Purpose
Magnetic Dynamics is a in development library for the study of very particular magnetic dynamical systems. It is based on an ongoing project of research "PIBIC" in the Universidade de Bras√≠lia (UnB), about magnetic the dynamicsdipoles. The main goal of the research is to study the dynamics of a 3-body system of magnetic dipoles.
